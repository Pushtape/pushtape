the 2.x branch is using pushtape profile, updating some references and media and adding an optional playlist feature
to get it just run <code>drush make https://raw.github.com/discipolo/pushtape/08c45e532948b9e40d13ccb37d8014fb3822a903/pushtape-devel.build</code>

the master branch is an inital attempt at creating an install profile extending pushtape including modules neccessary for importing from drupalgardens
it is probably of no interest to you at this point.
